# PNG to JPEG Image Converter

I made this small python program during my summer internship at <b>Box2BoxTech</b>, an E-commerce website for athletes.
At the time, the vendor images were large in size (10-20MB each) and were manually converted one by one consuming more time than necessary. 

I used some knowledge of recursion and directory traversal to create a program that traverses through a directory and creates a converted copy of all PNG files to JPEG, cutting down the total product image size and reducing load on the E-commerce platform.

### How to Run:

Run this Python file within/ next to folders to start the conversion of all .png files within current and nested directories to JPEG files.
